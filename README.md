# Shellenbarger-Data-Carpentry-Summer-2023-C

Files needed to complete my project analysis: 
Data File: Gaf Plant Height.csv Code File: Project for Data Carpentry Shellenbarger 

Were there anything you attempted that are not included in the project analysis: 
Yes, one of the beautiful things about R is there are multiple ways to do the same thing. I ran through a couple of codes until I found one I was really happy with. Also, my graphs went through many different versions until I was happy with the labels, and the lines were visible.

What are the next steps in your analysis to complete in the future?
I have a lot more than 3 sets of plant height to add to my file and then rerun this code, as well as sensor data and soil analysis that needs to be tested.

Brief Description of Project:
For my project, I ran a two-way repeated measure ANOVA of the plant height for the grain and fiber rate trial I am conducting on industrial hemp. This data was collected on a biweekly basis. For the analysis, the dependent variable is the average plant height(APH), and the independent variables are the fertilizer rates applied (Rate) and Days after planting(DAP). The alpha for my ANOVA is .05. The first alternative hypothesis of the APH ANOVA is that for each rate, there is no difference in the average plant height; the second alternative hypothesis would be that there is no difference between APH and DAP, and the null hypothesis would be that there is no interaction affecting APH between both Rate and DAP. After running the analysis for APH, I found that there is a statistical difference between APH, Rate, and DAP, as the p-value is .014, which is less than .05. This means that I should reject the null hypothesis and that there is an effect on APH from rate and DAP. I also included two graphs, one for the Standard deviation of plant height and one for the Average Plant Height.

Paragraph on learning experience and feedback for future students:
I struggled with class quite a bit, coding in R and stats are not my forte, but that doesn't mean I did not enjoy this class. It is rather enjoyable to work on code for hours and finally get that eureka moment when you run it and it works. With that being said, I think on a personal level, for some of the assignments, I tried too hard to stick to the code that was shown in the reading rather than trying to branch out or lean on code I had  learned before.  That being said if I can offer any advice to future students, don't be afraid to find code that works for you. The material for this class was very accessible, but I do wish the readings had a video of the r code being typed and run and explained. I would say overall, I learned a lot, and this course has definitely given me the confidence to be able to write the code and run the analysis for the rest of my data.
